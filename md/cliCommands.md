- Move/Rename file: `mv file1 test`
- Copying Files: `cp file3 file4`
- Copying Files and Directories: `cp -r some again`
- Show Path: `pwd`
- What to do with commands that return too many results: `locate *.png | more` or `locate *.png | less`
- create an empty file: `touch [file name]`
- copy file1 and create a new file named file2: `cp ~/file1 ~/public/file2`

- replaces the file with a .gz archive containing the file: `gzip [file]`
- decompresses a .gz archive: `gzip -d [archive.gz]`
- creates a file that includes whatever "text" we wrote with the command: `echo "text" > [file.txt]`
- appends the "text" at the end of the file.txt content, this is a safer way of running echo: `echo "text" >> [file.txt]`
- display all the contents of a text file at the terminal: `cat [text file]` or `cat [text file] | more` or `cat [text file] | less`
- We can also use `head [text file]` to only show the first ten lines, and `tail [text file]` to display the last ten lines.
- `grep "pattern" [file`] - search for a particular text pattern inside a text document. If the pattern is found, the command prints the line containing the pattern on the terminal. We can also search for a pattern in all the files in a directory, by using `grep -r "pattern" [dir]`
- look for a particular file or directory inside the current working directory: `find [file or directory]`
- look for a specific file or directory everywhere on the filesystem, and return all paths that contain it: `locate [file or directory]` We can use it with wildcards, such as locate *.png

### Commands Remove Files - RM

- delete a file: `rm [file]`
- Remove empty directories: `rmdir testing/example`
  - rmdir is functionally equivalent to the command rm -d.
- If you wish to remove a non-empty directory: `rm -r again`
- To delete a directory and all its contents, we need to use `rm -r [dir]`
- rm options:
  - `-f` Ignore nonexistant files, and never prompt before removing.
  - Prompt before every removal `-i`
  - Prompt once before removing more than three files, or when removing recursively. This option is less intrusive than -i, but still gives protection against most mistakes`-I`
  - `--interactive[=WHEN]` Prompt according to WHEN: never, once (-I), or always (-i). If WHEN is not specified, then prompt always.
  - `--one-file-system` When removing a hierarchy recursively, skip any directory that is on a file system different from that of the corresponding command line argument
  - `--no-preserve-root` Do not treat "/" (the root directory) in any special way.
  - `--preserve-root` Do not remove "/" (the root directory), which is the default behavior.
  - `-r, -R, --recursive` Remove directories and their contents recursively.
  - `-d, --dir` Remove empty directories. This option permits you to remove a directory without specifying -r/-R/--recursive, provided that the directory is empty. In other words, rm -d is equivalent to using rmdir.
  - `-v, --verbose` Verbose mode; explain at all times what is being done.
  - `--help` Display a help message, and exit.
  - `--version` Display version information, and exit.
- if /home/hope is currently your working directory `rm ./-file.txt`
- Remove all files in the working directory: `rm -f *`
- Remove the directory mydirectory, and any files and directories it contains. `rm -r mydirectory`
- Same as the above command, but you will never be prompted. `rm -rf mydirectory`
